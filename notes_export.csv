Moment of Inersia,"Moment of inertia (MOI) measures an object's resistance to changes in its rotational motion, acting as the rotational equivalent of mass in linear motion; it depends on the object's total mass and how that mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation, requiring more torque (rotational force) to spin or stop objects with higher MOI, like a spinning merry-go-round with people on the edges.
